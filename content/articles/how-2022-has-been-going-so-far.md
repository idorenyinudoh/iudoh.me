## How It's Been

Well...

2022 has been hectic so far tbh.

I resumed work on the 3rd. That week was not that fun. There was a lot of work to be done. I did a bit of them. Procrastinated some. The next week (last week) was better. I organized myself better but I believe I can do much better.

I've also come to realize that I've not done any writing anywhere since the beginning of the year. I think this is because I've not been able to organize myself properly. I've had a lot of article ideas since December but I've not made much progress concerning them.

This is not a good way to start the year ðŸ˜”

I also took a bold step and put some money into crypto, without any prior knowledge of it. I think that motivated me to want to learn about it. So I decided to enroll in a [Bitcoin course by Buycoins](https://buycoins-learning.teachable.com/p/introduction-to-bitcoin) (one that I planned on enrolling in since last year). As you probably guessed, I haven't gotten past the first page.

I also want to learn what web3 is all about and probably get in-depth into it. However, I haven't made any progress on that either.

## How It'll Be

Starting tomorrow, I'll start being more conscious of my time.

I'll make sure I start waking up early, working out, doing all them chores, coding, writing, rest, and repeat. I really want to apply this routine man. Ik it'll take a lot of discipline but I'm ready for it.

I'll make some time for learning blockchain and web3 too!

## Conclusion

I guess that's it.

I think I just figured I'll take myself more seriously by making this public. So, let's see how it goes.

Thanks for watching.
