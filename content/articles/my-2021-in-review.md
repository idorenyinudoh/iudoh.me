2021 has been one hell of a year for me. It was my year of… My year of… I think I’ll just start typing.

I can't recall everything that happened on a monthly basis so I'll just do this in various facets.

## Technical Writing

I discovered technical writing late last year and published [my first article](https://css-tricks.com/give-users-control-the-media-session-api/) on CSS-Tricks. When I got paid, I was like — “Wow, this is real” — despite the fact that I knew how much I was getting for the article lol. It just seemed surreal. Hence, I made up my mind that this year, I’ll publish at least one article a month.

I didn’t meet that goal but this year, I’ve written up to 13 articles. I wrote some for some publications and the rest, freelance. That’s right! I had some people reach out to me to write for them because they liked some articles I had written. It’s a good feeling tbh. Knowing your work is being seen by people home and abroad. Recall that my first article was published in December last year.

This is proof that when you believe in yourself and work hard, your efforts will definitely pay off and the stars will testify to what great impact you’ve made. Okay maybe ignore the stars part but you get the drift lol. I’ve definitely improved as a writer and next year, I plan on writing more as I’ve just created this blog. 🎉

## School

I’m done, man. Finally.

I continued online classes from January till March before I resumed again physically in school. As usual, I was tired of the whole school thing and just wanted to be done. You’ll expect to hear that I put my head down and focused on my academics for the months I had left (I was in my fourth year). But no! I was basically chilling and enjoying my technical writing money. Then when I was close to spending it all, I’d start brainstorming for article ideas lol.

When my mates left school, I had to stay behind for about two months because I had to retake two courses I failed in my second year. Why does everything have to be two lol? For that period, I can remember I was broke for about two weeks because a client scammed me lol. Fml man. Then I had to start working on another article to maintain my sanity. I also worked out a little. Oh! I sold shawarma in my hall too! It was against the school’s rules to sell stuff in the hall so when I got caught, it was bad. Lost ₦6000 that day. Fuck you, Mr. Chi (Mr. Chi was the porter). And that fucking security man. I also got paid for the article I previously published that day. So life wasn’t that bad.

I had to wait another week in school because the score for an exam I took online in 2020 was missing. Typing this thing now, I can’t help laughing. I left school in August after the lecturer for that course promised me she’ll rectify it. As you probably guessed, she didn’t.

## Fitness

I worked out on some days while I was in school. And then, I ate a lot after working out. At a point, I told myself I’d pause working out till I got home.

So, here I was at home. Eating like I was a judge for Food Network’s Chopped.

I think I’ll just start working out next year again. Stop smiling!

## Code

Another goal I set for myself for when I got home was to learn Vue and Nuxt. I actually achieved that. Jokes on you haha.

I took a course on Vue, read the documentation, and built my website. After that, I decided to read the Nuxt docs and rebuild the website in Nuxt. It was fun actually.

When I was done, I decided to work on something else. I created a Vue component to publish on npm. It’s a lightweight range input that is completely customizable and has a lot of features but apparently, npm says only one person thinks so. Check out [aesth-vue-range-input](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aesth-vue-range-input) and let me know what you think.

After I completed this, I got bored of working on personal projects. So I was scrolling on LinkedIn when I saw a job posting for a Software Engineer at [Acumen Digital](https://acumen.digital/). The posting had expired by about a week but I still applied. I’d been a fan of Acumen for a long while, which was why I could see the job posting. So when I got a mail that I was going to be interviewed, I was so excited. After about the third phase of the interview process, I was let go because I didn’t complete the tasks I was given (thanks to you, toothache).

However, after about a week, I got an internship offer from Acumen. That was in October. I’ve totally enjoyed working at Acumen. It’s a fun-filled place filled with lots of intellectual beings. Everyone here’s just too good at what they do. It’s mind-blowing. For me, at least. Next year, I’ll be starting as a full-time Software Engineer. Another proof that when you aspire to desire, your enemies have no choice but to transpire everything they conspired about you. Look at that 😂

## Entertainment

This year, I’m really grateful I found artists like Loyle Carner and Kota the Friend. They inspired me big time. Check out [my Spotify profile](https://open.spotify.com/user/31g2xntmpvowphzjt3kvasz6f66q?si=8f76905f9c234475).

I also got to see some amazing shows like Peaky Blinders, SUITS, Billions, and WestWorld. I plan on rewatching some but I’ll need time for that.

I’ve been considering pursuing a career in music for a while now too. Harry Mack is a big inspiration to me here. Idk I think I’ll be successful as a rapper.

## Finance

This year, I made a lot of money than I’ve ever made. I plan on writing some finance articles in the coming year. I also spent a lot this year. I finally bought stuff from ASOS rather than just saving items. It felt good tbh. I noticed I’ve been one to save and save money and not actually spoil myself. This year, I made some progress with spoiling myself, and like every other thing, I hope to do more next year.

## Feelings

Whew. What didn’t happen this year?

I and anxiety became closer to each other more than ever. Thanks to school… and that thing called love. I’ve also not been prouder of myself than I have this year. I’ve been sad — for legitimate reasons and most times, for things I can’t wrap my head around. I’ve been angry, because of the country I’m a citizen of. I’ve been optimistic. Still am. I’ve been hurt too. I’ve been… loved? Have I been loved? Hey, do you love me? That reminds me, I started liking this girl at my workplace. She’s just so pretty man. Reserved, too. And smart. But from the look of things, I’ll have to move on. Fml man.

Considering everything, I’m grateful to God because all these events made me who I am today. I’m grateful to you too. For getting this far. Thank you 🙏🏽

## Conclusion

Now that I’m done, I’d say 2021 has been my year of self-awareness. I’d never really focused on myself before now so when I started to do that, I started to learn some things about myself that I didn’t know before. It’s fulfilling. You should try it sometime. 

Also, shout out to everyone that has helped me this year. Even if you might not read this, more power to you. ✊🏽

I’m actually really looking forward to 2022. I already have some goals like working out, actually understanding this blockchain thing, and some other stuff I can’t remember rn. Plan for next year, guys. And maybe write them down. Don’t be like me.

Once again, thank you for reading this piece. Do enjoy the rest of your day and yeah, compliments of the season.
